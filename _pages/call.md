## Submission Guidelines

To ensure your submission is considered, please adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Formatting Instructions**: Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the IEEE format available at **[style files](https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html)**. Papers need to be prepared and submitted as a single file: We accept papers, including survey/vision/tutorials/demos and late-breaking results, that fall under short papers of at most 6 pages (two columns) and long papers up to 12 pages (two columns), with unlimited pages for references. While your submission can contain a supplement or appendix, please note that reviewers are not obliged to review supplementary material.
*   **Dual Submission Policy**: A paper submitted to LLM + Vector Data workshop cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time and it must be original work not described in any prior publication. A prior publication is a paper that has been accepted for presentation at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or an article that has been accepted for publication in a refereed journal. 
*   **Reviews**: The review process will be single-blind.
