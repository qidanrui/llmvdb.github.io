**Title:**
<br/> Towards Bridging Maximum Inner Product and Nearest Neighbor Search


**Abstract:**
<br/> Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) has emerged as a central primitive in modern data systems, powering applications from recommendation engines to large-scale retrieval. Yet it remains beset by two intertwined challenges: the cost of redundant computation without metric guarantees, and the loss of data topology when forced into Euclidean projections. This talk will weave a single narrative that begins by unveiling a theoretical bridge between MIPS and Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS), showing how a query-scaled equivalence unlocks the full power of graph-based indices without lossy transformations. Building on this foundation, we then confront the metric duality head-on—demonstrating that Inner Product and Euclidean measures need not be adversaries but complementary allies. By stitching these metrics together in index design and search dynamics, our unified graph framework adapts to local data topology, prunes redundant paths early, and dynamically switches similarity modes. The result is an end-to-end solution that delivers up to 4× speedups in diverse real-world datasets while slashing index size and preserving topological fidelity. Throughout the talk, you’ll see how foundational insights translate seamlessly into practical, scalable systems—culminating in industry deployments that bring these advances to billions of daily queries.
