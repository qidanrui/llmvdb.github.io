**Title:**
<br/> Beyond Text: Graph-Enhanced LLMs for Reasoning and Mixed-Type Data Imputation


**Abstract:**
<br/> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, when it comes to structured reasoning, especially over heterogeneous or mixed-type data, their performance often falls short. In this talk, we will present two complementary lines of work, Paths-over-Graph (PoG) which augments LLMs reasoning with dynamic graph traversal strategies, and UnIMP which enhances data imputation for mixed-type data through high-order message passing. We will discuss how graph-enhanced LLMs can bridge language and structure, enabling more accurate and reliable reasoning across knowledge and data-centric tasks.
