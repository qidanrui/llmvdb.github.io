**Title:**
<br/> The Challenges of Personal Data Management System for Agentic AI on AIphones


**Abstract:**
<br/> In the Agentic AI era, AI-terminal devices need to provide personalized assistants (Agents) with two capabilities: the ability to understand the world (LLM) and the ability to understand users (ArkData/GaussPD). This talk focuses on the challenges encountered in building the Harmony data foundation platform by streamlining user data silos, integrating user data, and achieving in-depth understanding of users. We hope that the academics and industries will work together to solve all these challenges.
